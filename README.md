# Empty-Directories
Find and delete all empty or small-size directories
Since Windows doesn't let you sort folders by their size, this program will go through all the folders of the current directory it is placed in and find all folders that are equal to or smaller than the user-specified size. It will then prompt the user to confirm if they want to delete the found folders.

I made this because I kept finding myself deleting music through a music player program but it would leave an empty folder where the album used to be; as a result, I had a bunch of empty folders or just folders with the album art in it. Windows made it really difficult to locate these particular small folders so this was my solution.
